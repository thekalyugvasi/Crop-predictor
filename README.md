# 🌾 AgroVITa - Smart Agriculture Platform

AgroVITa is a web-based platform designed to enhance agricultural productivity through intelligent crop prediction and a community-driven machinery marketplace. This project leverages machine learning, geolocation, and modern web technologies to empower farmers with data-driven insights and better access to tools.

## 👨‍🔬 Project Highlights

- **ML-Powered Crop Prediction** using historical environmental data
- **Interactive Marketplace** for renting, buying, and selling agricultural tools
- **Real-time Data Pipeline** (Upcoming) using FastAPI and geolocation inputs
- **Fully Modular Backend** built with Spring Boot
- **Responsive Frontend** integrated using Thymeleaf and Tailwind CSS

---

## 🔧 Technologies Used

### Machine Learning & Data
- **Python**, **pandas**, **numpy**, **scikit-learn**, **XGBoost**
- **Joblib** – for model serialization
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn** – for EDA & visualization

### Web Development
- **Flask** – REST API for serving ML model
- **Java**, **Spring Boot** – Backend structure
- **Thymeleaf**, **Tailwind CSS** – Frontend rendering
- **Maven** – Dependency & build management

## 🚀 Features

### 🌱 Crop Prediction System
- Collects and preprocesses user/environmental data
- Performs exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Trains multiple ML models and compares their performance
- Uses **XGBoost** for final prediction due to highest accuracy
- Serves predictions via a Flask REST API

### 🛠️ Agricultural Machinery Marketplace
- Farmers can list, rent, or purchase equipment
- Supports seller-buyer interaction and resource sharing
- Future integration with secure payment APIs
